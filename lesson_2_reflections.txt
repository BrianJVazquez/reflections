Lesson 2 Reflections

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different from the repository and working directory in that it only connects the files that you want to commit to the repository that you want to commit them to. This helps in not complicating the process of commits to a directory so that every files does not appear in each HEAD.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By adding one file at a time, we can use the staging area to compare updated files between staging area and working directory, then add more files to staging area as you go through your commit then compare staging area to most recent commit in the Repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Some situtations would include exploring new ideas that you may want to add without affecting your original branch. Other situations may be if you want to creat another version of the project or file that may have similar features.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
They help visualize the tree associated with your master branch and created branches from the master (HEAD). They also help you see where in the project you are currently editing.
